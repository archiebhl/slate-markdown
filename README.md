# Slate Markdown Editor

## Project Overview

This is a highly customized, lightweight Markdown editor built on CodeMirror 6.

The core philosophy of this project is to achieve a seamless markdown editing experience close to WYSIWYG in VSCode, without the clunkiness of many full-fledged editors. The project is heavily inspired by the likes of Typora and Obsidian.md. In an effort to make markdown editing seamless, the end result is something resembling a mix between EasyMDE and Obsidian.md's live preview mode.

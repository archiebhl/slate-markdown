# Slate Markdown Editor

## Project Overview

This is a highly customized, lightweight Markdown editor built on EasyMDE (which uses CodeMirror 5).

The core philosophy of this project is to achieve a seamless WYSIWYG markdown editing experience in VSCode without the clunkiness of many full-fledged editors. The project is heavily inspired by the likes of Typora and Obsidian.md.
